# REST API specification for querying RD resources (Virtual Platform Level 2)

> This API specification is defined in the context of the EJPRD project, complying with the latest [Beacon v2 Specification](https://github.com/ga4gh-beacon/beacon-v2).

In this work, we present API specification for querying RD patient registries, biobanks and similar resources at the safe record level (i.e, resources whose available assets are described by RD patient data). Resources that implement this specification would ideally collect data based on the set of common data elements for rare diseases registration, as recommended by the European commission Joint Research Centre. In this specification, where possible, we also make use of ontological terms recommended by the CDE semantic data model group.

Latest version (v2.0) of this specification is available on Swagger here: https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/VM172_1/vp_individuals/v2.0 

<hr>

<h2 id="-specification-"> Specification </h2>

The request and response conforms to the [Beacon Reference Framework](https://github.com/ga4gh-beacon/beacon-v2). This Specification defines two types of endpoints - **[The Query Endpoints](#-query-endpoints-)** and **[The Informational Endpoints](#-informational-endpoints-)**. 

[Informational Endpoints](#-informational-endpoints-) are simple GET requests without needing a request body, and respond with information relavant to this Beacon Specification. These are: /info, /configuration, /entry_types, /filtering_terms and /map. A special /service-info endpoint (also a GET request), responds with metadata relevant to this Beacon using the [GA4GH ServiceInfo format](https://github.com/ga4gh-discovery/ga4gh-service-info/). 

[Query Endpoints](#-query-endpoints-) require the requester to provide a JSON body and send request using the POST method. This document defines three query endpoints to query resources using filters - [/individuals](#-individuals-endpoint), [/biosamples](#-biosamples-endpoint) and [/catalogs](#-catalogs-endpoint-). 

<hr>

<h2 id="-query-endpoints-"> Query Endpoints </h2>

This specification defines POST endpoints to request information about resources. Each endpoint makes use of the [Filters](http://docs.genomebeacons.org/filters/) capability of the Beacon API.

<h3 id="-individuals-endpoint"> Individuals endpoint</h3>

> **HTTP Request Method : POST**

[/individuals](https://github.com/ejp-rd-vp/vp-api-specs/blob/main/vp_api_v0.3.yml) endpoint returns the **__maximum value of individuals within a specified range__** from a RD resource. Filters are provided as a part of the body while using a HTTP POST request to query resources. 

Please **do not use HTTP GET method** to query the individuals endpoint, as it is **not permitted** per this specification, and will result in a 403 error response.

<h4 id="-list-of-filters-and-permitted-values-for-the-individuals-endpoint-"> List of filters and permitted values for the individuals endpoint </h4>

<h3 id="-individuals-filters-description-"> Individuals Filters Description </h3>

**Sex**: The biological sex of an individual patient.

**Disease or Disorder**: All rare diseases that have been diagnosed **within an individual**, to encompase, but not distinguish between all levels of diagnosis such as definitive, differential, provisional, etc.,

**Phenotype**: HPO terms of all phenotypes observed **within an individual**.

**Causative Genes**: All genes which have been deemed as causative of one or more of the diagnosed rare diseases **in an individual**, encompassing and not distinguishing between all certainty levels of casuality.

**Age this year**: Age at the end of the current year. -/+ will be added to all age queries when executed by the query engine at the resource. 

**Symptom Onset**: Age at the manifestation of a rare disease. For individuals with more than one rare disease, this filter will look at all age of manifestations independently. -/+ will be added to all age queries when executed by the query engine at the resource. 

**Age at diagnosis**: Age at the diagnosis of a rare disease. For individuals with more than one rare disease, this filter will look at all age of manifestations independently. -/+ will be added to all age queries when executed by the query engine at the resource.

**EXAMPLE /individuals RESPONSE**


```JSON

      "beaconId": "Responding unique Beacon ID in reverse domain name notation",
      "returnedGranularity": "count"

  "response": {
     "resultSets": [
      {
         "id": "Vivify",
         "type": "dataset", 
         "exists": true,
         "resultCount": 80,
         "info": {
            "resultCountDescription": {
               "minRange": 71,
               "maxRange": 80

      }
    ]
  },
  "responseSummary":{
    "exists": true,
    "numTotalResults": 80
  }
}
```

The "resultCount" attribute in the above response is the **maximum value of whatever range that result** is within, rather than giving out the actual count of individuals. More information on responding using ranges can be found [here](#ranges). 

The filter **SHOULD** be one of the terms from the [filters and permitted values table](#individuals). Please note that not all resources will support all of the filters. In such cases the response should include a [warning message in the 'info' part](#warning-response-example) indicating which requested filters are unsupported and these were not included in the query.

<h3 id="-biosamples-endpoint"> Biosamples endpoint</h3>

> **HTTP Request Method : POST**

Similarly to the `/individuals` endpoint, `/biosamples` endpoint returns the **__maximum value of biosamples within a specified range__** from an RD resource (usually the resource is a Biobank). Queries are performed in the same way as for `/individuals` endpoint, adding filters in the body of the request.

Please **do not use HTTP GET method** to query the biosamples endpoint, as it is **not permitted** per this specification, and will result in a 403 error response.

**Disease or Disorder**: All rare diseases that are associated **within a catalog**. It corresponds to the `dcat:theme` property of the Resource Metadata Schema. The values follow CURIE syntax and use the `ordo:` prefix.

**Phenotype**: HPO terms of all phenotypes observed **within a catalog** of rare disease resources. The values follow CURIE syntax and use the `HP:` prefix. 

**ID**: The resource identifier ID **within the catalog**. It corresponds to the identifier of the RDF resource

**Name**: The name of the resource in the **catalog**. It corresponds to the `dct:title` of the Resource Metadata Schema

**Description**: The description of the resource in the **catalog**. It corresponds to the `dct:description` property of the Resource Metadata Schema

**Organisation**: The organisation that owns the resouce. It corresponds to the dct:publisher property. 

**Resource Types**: Types of resources **within the catalog**. Permitted values for this filter are the type of resources in the Resource Metadata Schema:  `ejprd:PatientRegistry`, `ejprd:Biobank`, `ejprd:Guideline`, `dcat:Datasest` or an array of any of these values.

<h3 id="catalogs-response">Catalogs Response</h3>

The response is a Beacon Collection response that corresponds to a Resource described by the Resource Metadata Schema. Depending on the resource type, the properties may slighlty differ: for example some resource types can have properties that others don't have. Notice that an important field in all resources is the `@context` that specifies the semantics of the properties returned. It must be the [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ejp-rd-vp/vp-api-specs/main/json-ld-contexts/ejprd-context.json) to the `json-ld-contexts/ejprd-context.json` file  in this repository. The schemas for each specific resource are in the `/schemas` directory.
In the meta section of the response, the `returnedSchemas` object must specify the correct json schema for the resource. An example is:

```JSON
"returnedSchemas": [
    {
        "entityType": "resources",
        "schema": "ejprd-biobank-registry-v1.0.0",
        "name": "EJPRD schema for biobank and patient registry",

        "version": "v1.0.0"
    }
]

<h2 id="-authentication-using-header-"> Authentication using Header </h2>

Since the specification allows for record level queries of individuals, additional information is required in the request header to verify the requester is authorised:

<table>
<thead>
<th>Header Attribute</th>
<th>Header Value</th>
<th>Purpose</th>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>auth-key</td><td>Token provided by resource</td><td>Indicates requester is authorised (required)</td></tr>
<tr><td>auth-token</td><td>Bearer token, True, False</td><td>Indicates requesting user's logged in status (optional)</td></tr>
<tr><td>authentication-url</td><td>Bearer token authentication provider</td><td>Enables validation of bearer token (optional)</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

> **Note:** Presence of a bearer token is equivalent to auth-token:True

> **Note:** Implementers can provide distinct auth-keys to each requester or a single auth-key to all requesters.

<h2 id="-understanding-the-query-"> Understanding the query </h2>

<h3 id="-syntax-and-usage-"> Syntax and Usage: </h3>

> Method: POST

There are 3 types of Beacon queries that this specification currently supports: 
1. [Alphanumerical Query](http://docs.genomebeacons.org/filters/#exact-value-query)
2. [Numerical Query](http://docs.genomebeacons.org/filters/#numerical-value-query)
3. [Ontology Query](http://docs.genomebeacons.org/filters/#simple-curie-based-filters-query)

The following JSON body depicts the typical usage of filters to query resources. 
   * Alphanumeric filters **require** the use of id, operator(=) and value properties. 
   * Ontology filters only require the 'id' property to query resources.
   * Numeric filters also require id, operator and value properties. These filters differ from the alphanumeric filters as it is also possible to use comparison operators (>=,>,<=,<) along with '='.

These usage rules are illustrated using a general syntax as below:

```JSON
{
  "meta": {
    "apiVersion": "v2.0"
  },
  "query": {
    "filters": [
      {
        "id": "AlphanumericFilter_id",
        "operator": "=",
        "value":"AlphanumericFilter_value"
        
      },
      {
        "id": "AlphanumericFilter_id",
        "operator": "=",
        "value":"AlphanumericFilter_value"
      },
      { 
        "id": "OntologyFilter_value"
      }
    ],
     "requestedGranularity": "boolean"
  }
}
```

[ ^ Back to the top](#top)

<hr>

As shown above, different types of filters can be sent in a single query. These are further elucidated below. 

<h4 id="beacon-queries-using-multiples-of-the-same-type-of-filter-and-logical-operator-between-filters"> Beacon queries using multiple filters (AND logical operator between filters):</h4>

```JSON
{
"query": {
      "filters": [
        {
          "id": "Orphanet_34587" 
        },
        {
          "id": "data_2295",
          "operator": "=",
          "value": "LAMP2"
        }
      ]
    }
}
```

This filter is asking for individuals that have been diagnosed with Danon disease (Orphanet_34587) **and** where LAMP2 gene has been identified as causative. These filters are handled independently, this means that individuals with Danon disease where LAMP2 has been identified as a causative gene, specifically for Danon disease, will match the query. It also means that individuals with Danon disease and where LAMP2 has been identified as a causative gene for a second rare disease, other than Danon disease, will also match this query.

<h4 id="beacon-queries-using-multiple-values-as-in-phenotype-or-disease-filters-and-logical-operator-between-filter-values">Beacon queries using multiples of the same type of filter (AND logical operator between filters):</h4>

To query for individuals with more than one instance of any of the filters you can send multiple of the same filter, such as in the below example:

> Ontology Filter Example:

```JSON
{
"query": 
    {
      "filters": [
        {
          "id": "Orphanet_34587"
        },
        {
          "id": "Orphanet_1653"
        }
      ]
   }
}
```
This query is looking for individuals with Danon disease ("Orphanet_34587") AND Dentin dysplasia ("Orphanet_1653").

> Alphanumeric Filter example: 

```JSON
{
"query": 
    {
      "filters": [
        {
          "id": "Available Materials",
          "operator": "=",
          "value": "RNA sequence"          
        },
        {
          "id": "Available Materials",
          "operator": "=",
          "value": "Whole Genome Sequence"
        }
      ]
   }
}
```
This query is looking if there are any individuals with RNA sequence information AND Whole Genome Sequence information available.

<h4 id="beacon-queries-using-multiples-of-the-same-type-of-filter-or-logical-operator-between-filters">Beacon queries using multiples of the same type of filter (OR logical operator between filters):</h4>

```JSON
{
"query": 
    {
      "filters": [
        {
          "id": ["Orphanet_34587","Orphanet_1653"]
        }
      ]
   }
}
```
This query is looking for individuals either with Danon disease (Orphanet_34587) OR Dentin dysplasia (Orphanet_1653).

> **Note**: There are no OR operators available **between** filters with beacon queries.

All of the defined filters are optional, the user can provide as many or as few as wanted and the resource does not have to implement all filters.

If a user sends a query with a filter not supported by a resource, then the resource should complete the query but ignore the unsupported filter(s) and respond as usual, but with a warning noting that certain filters were ignored as they are unsupported.

The warning messages will be provided within the [`info`](#partial-query-matches-with-warning-messages)  section of the Beacon.

This request is asking for females with Danon disease with LAMP2 being identified as a causative gene.

This request is sent to a resource which does not hold information about causative genes but does hold information about diagnoses and sex, an example response which could be returned is outlined below:

<h2 id="-understanding-the-response-with-ranges-for-individuals-and-biospecimens"> Understanding the response with ranges (for /individuals and /biospecimens)</h2>

In the examples of the response for the `/individuals` and `/biosamples` endpoints, information of the resultant dataset matching the query is provided within the **`resultSets`** attribute. 

To provide flexibility for implementers between using a range, the `info` section of each resultant dataset in `resultSets` need to conform to the following standardised structure:

```JSON
"info": {
   "resultCountDescription": {
      "minRange": N,
      "maxRange": N
   },
   "contactPoint": "Person/point of contact",
   "contactEmail": "Email for contact regarding this dataset/resource", 
   "contactURL": "URL of the implementer"
}
```

> **Note**: Here, N is an integer where the implementer can respond with **"minRange" & "maxRange"** (if employing a range) - the maximum value of whatever range that result is within, whereupon the "maxRange" value should match the "resultCount" value and the "numTotalResults" value.

**Example response employing a range:**

```JSON
{
  "meta": {
      "apiVersion": "v2.0",
      "beaconId": "Responding unique Beacon ID in reverse domain name notation",
      "returnedGranularity": "count"
  },
  "response": {
     "resultSets": [
      {
         "id": "Vivify",
         "type": "dataset", 
         "exists": true,
         "resultCount": 80,
         "info": {
            "resultCountDescription": {
               "minRange": 71,
               "maxRange": 80
            },
            "contactPoint": "admin",
            "contactEmail": "admin@cafevariome.org", 
            "contactURL": "rdnexusdev.molgeniscloud.org/cv2/"
         }      
      }
    ]
  },
  "responseSummary":{
    "exists": true,
    "numTotalResults": 80
  }
}
```

In this example, the result could be a count of individuals between 71 to 80 (the resource only responds with ranges of size 10).
