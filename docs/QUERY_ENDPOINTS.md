# Query Endpoints (Mandatory to implement at least one of the query endpoints)

This specification defines POST endpoints to request information about resources. Each endpoint makes use of the [Filters](http://docs.genomebeacons.org/filters/) capability of the Beacon API.

There are three supported endpoints:

 * [Individuals endpoint](./INDIVIDUALS.md)
 * [Biosamples endpoint](./BIOSAMPLES.md)
 * [Catalogs endpoint](./CATALOGS.md)
