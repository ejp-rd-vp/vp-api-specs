# Authentication using Header 

Since the specification allows for record level queries of individuals, additional information is required in the request header to verify the requester is authorised:

<table>
<thead>
<th>Header Attribute</th>
<th>Header Value</th>
<th>Purpose</th>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>auth-key</td><td>Token provided by resource</td><td>Indicates requester is authorised (required)</td></tr>
<tr><td>auth-token</td><td>Bearer token, True, False</td><td>Indicates requesting user's logged in status (optional)</td></tr>
<tr><td>authentication-url</td><td>Bearer token authentication provider</td><td>Enables validation of bearer token (optional)</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

> **Note:** Presence of a bearer token is equivalent to auth-token:True

> **Note:** Implementers can provide distinct auth-keys to each requester or a single auth-key to all requesters.
